# Project: Student Scheduling Assistant
### Project Goal
Allow students to have an easy and intuitive way of selecting courses. Our project will take away some of the annoyances that students have while selecting courses for upcoming semesters. This includes but is not limited to, keeping track of when class times are, conflicting class times, as well as an easy to use user interface.
### Project Description
Our application will allow the user (a student) to enter courses. For each course, the student will then add several sections, each having a specific timetable (ex: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 8:30-9:20AM). Using that information, the program will then calculate the best possible combinations of sections (one for each course), such that the resulting schedule can fit as many different courses as possible.
Usually students must do this process manually when registering for courses since the UNB website does not provide any help in that regard. Our project will help students by doing that process for them.
Only the basic process is depicted here, a lot of functionality will be added as we work on the project (ex: different input methods, options to customize the process, different methods of processing, possibility to add restrictions, etc.)
Our program will be fully made using Java, and will function via a GUI made using JavaFX.

### To Download
You can download the Student Scheduling Assistant.jar file and run it on your computer. The only requirement to be able tu run it is to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or more installed on your computer.
**Note:** This .jar build has only been slightly tested on different computers/operating systems. If the program doesn't work, there may be other restrictions/requirements that we do not know of. For example, we have had some issues on Linux regarding the display of schedules (after clicking the generate button).
